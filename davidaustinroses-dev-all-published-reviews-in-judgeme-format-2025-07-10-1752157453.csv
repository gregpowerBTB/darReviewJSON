"A rose by any other name...","Desdemona is one of my all time favourite roses, and my enthusiasm for it has spread to several of my neighbours so it is a delight to walk down my street in summer when it is in flower, and I often see complete strangers leaning over the garden wall to get a waft of the glorious scent when it is in flower - and it flowers for a long season. It is one of the healthiest roses I have ever grown, and it is a perfect size: it has a strong presence but remains fairly well behaved and does not jostle other plants in the same bed. There is something exquisite about the blush pink buds opening to white as they mature, and I love the subtlety and nostalgia of the old rose scent, not too sweet, not too sharp, and with a heady depth of fragrance that takes me right back to childhood and my mothers garden. I plant it everywhere - see one I planted five years ago under a pavilion in a garden in Kensington.","5","2025-02-19 00:00:00 UTC","judge-me","ok","Joan Scanlon","joanscanlon@btinternet.com","4113835917393","desdemona","","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1740135577__1740135567529-20200513_131857__original.jpg, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/user-files-1/servar/198908/2b212685-0f2b-4e39-bb5f-3840fa7056f3/da12cbe9-b97e-4d5a-a33e-5ffc113a5716/2025-02-19T23%253A10%253A33.213490%252B00%253A00/20200513_131857.jpg","","","review-f8b10297-2fb6-4d47-b00b-b86693b50369"

"Cupped flower, glossy leaves","The Olivia has beautiful dark green glossy leaves and delicate almost translucent pink petals forming a cupped shape. The scent is delicate, sometimes only fragrant on a warm summers day. We have found that the Olivia is a delicate rose bush, she has yet to find her vigor, at 3 years old she is still flimsy and her stems too weak to hold a full bush shape. This year again we.have pruned her well, wedding out any canes less than a pencil thickness in hope of new vigor. Our emily bronze, eustacia vye and Lichfield angel have flourished more so than Olivia. I'm still really hoping for a beautiful Olivia hedge.

"","What I love about Eustacia Vye. The rose is a good healthy grower, yet stays more compact than some other DA varieties, forming a nice rounding shrub of a medium size. It blooms well, repeat is slower than on some other DA varieties, but its health makes up for the slower repeat. I love Eustacia's flowers, they are constantly changing in form and colour. In sunny conditions the flowers are paling to peach colours, while on cloudier days the blooms are a warm pink. It has a wonderful fruity fragrance. I would definitely recommend this rose.","4","2025-02-19 00:00:00 UTC","judge-me","ok","Frank","franknieuwenhuis@tutanota.com","4113840635985","eustacia-vye","","","","","","review-2508a692-4931-40dc-b106-0f675de2ec08"

"Gertrude Jekyll","I love this rose, the smell is divine and is the traditional old rose smell that is strong and fills the air as you walk past. So much so I've bought another to put near my front door to grow up an obelisk and cant wait for summer and to be met with its smell when I get home. The flowers are a lovely deep pink and repeat flowering, often still going when the others have finished blooming. I've used it also as a climbing rose screen on a fence and gives good coverage. Need to monitor for black spot but that is all roses now with how wet it always is. Seems very resilient to rust.

It is planted in a sheltered spot and I was a little anxious that it might not like the lack of direct sunlight, but it seems very happy.

 As the growing season progressed I was also struck by the amount of flowers that were produced so I decided I must have one.
 I planted the bare root rose in a very sunny position and for the first session it took a while to get going. Last year it produced a number of strong healthy new stems and a good quantity of flowers so this year I am looking forward to seeing it in it's full glory.

"Strong grower and sunny flower","As with all David Austin roses, Golden Celebration is a strong grower with beautiful flowers. Mine was to replace a very old 'Golden Wedding' rose inherited from my parents' garden. It had been a present for their 50th wedding anniversary, but eventually succumbed to old age. Golden Celebration is doing well, considering I planted it in the same place. One problem is that with all the rain last year, its growth was sappy, and some of the long stems, once flowering, bent right over, even to the ground. The flowers were quite large, with a mild scent, and long lasting, and of a gorgeous gold.","4","2025-02-11 00:00:00 UTC","judge-me","ok","Jane Clare","jane.clare@zen.co.uk","4113846042705","golden-celebration","","","","","","review-e924b994-f497-4732-bd23-3843df3f23ea"

"","I bought two of these roses in October 2023 and planted them in pots in a soil and compost mixture with som rose fertiliser.
 They developed and flowered well in 2023 with copious blooms through the autumn as advertised and expected.
 After the first flowering they developed vigorous new shoots about twice as high as the original plants which later also developed flowers.
 I pruned them back to the original heights in winter 2023, fertilised them again and they performed well in 2024 with more tall new vigorous flowering shoots.
 I pruned them back again in autumn 2024 and they are still looking very healthy.
 The tall shoots were about twice the height of the original plants, which fill the space in my border as required.
 I am very pleased with the results and the roses completely fulfil my needs and expectations
 The plants were more vigorous than I expected but respond well to pruning and occasional watering and give copious beautiful large white flowers throughout the flowering season.","5","2025-02-11 00:00:00 UTC","judge-me","ok","Christopher Pearce","chris@cpearces.plus.com","4113855774801","kew-gardens","","","","","","review-2f2d6f19-4859-45ae-af7c-aba0581eb0b9"

"","Bought for my dad’s 86th birthday for him and his wife and he was delighted with it. I opted for the £2.95 card delivery. It arrived within a few days so I’m glad I didn’t bother with fast delivery costs. I’m glad I spent the £3 for the hard copy of the voucher, as it is a lovely, tasteful, well designed card which is much more personal than an email print out. The voucher lasts for two years so the recipient has lots of choice about when to go. They’re planning their visit for June/ July when the roses should be at their best. It’s a lovely thing to look forward to for the summer (especially in the current weather with snow on the ground)!

"","The roses are in pots at the end of some stone steps. They are not quite the same lollipop tops as each other & one has white fly, but overall they are a couple of pretty good standard roses. I had a Harlow Carr hedge before & it is mainly the beautiful fragrance I wanted. You get a waft as you mount the steps between them. 
David Austin is the best rose grower in the country in my opinion.","5","2023-06-19 15:17:22 UTC","shop-app","ok","Rosalind Bartlett","roserama@gmail.com","4114116149329","harlow-carr-standard-rose-potted","","","","","","shop-2519111-14256072-2b385c96-980d-40df-ae68-c63f6709081d"

My issue is I raised an issue, customer service staff do everything they can to make return very difficult so you end up keeping a damaged plant as you can’t be bothered to keep arguing & jumping through ridiculous hoops.","1","2023-07-21 11:08:39 UTC","shop-app","ok","Deborah Shaw","debsjacob@yahoo.co.uk","4114101698641","gentle-hermione-shrub-rose-potted","","","","","","shop-2519111-33373332-bb2ad8ea-b798-4817-87f6-b94fedbfa781"

It’s A really strong grower with long leaders and beautiful flowers like creamy white water lilies and it reliably repeats.

"Fantastic Rose for a large pot.","I’ve got 2 Vanessa Bell roses growing in 2 large pot, and they have been absolutely lovely. The buds open with a soft blush of pink and turn into elegant, medium-sized cups in generous clusters. The colour is gentle and cheerful—pale yellow fading to white at the edges, with a rich yellow centre that glows, especially in the early morning light.

The fragrance is one of the best things about it—fresh and slightly unusual, like green tea with a bit of lemon and honey. It’s subtle but noticeable, especially when the sun’s been on it for a bit.

Even in a container, it’s grown into a tidy, upright shrub with a nice full shape. It’s stayed healthy and blooms reliably, which is always a bonus when growing in pots.

I also really like that it’s named after Vanessa Bell, the artist and sister of Virginia Woolf—it adds a bit of character and history to the garden, which I appreciate.

All in all, a beautifully scented, easy-to-care-for rose that looks stunning in a container. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone short on space or wanting to brighten up a patio or balcony.","5","2025-04-10 17:08:30 UTC","web","ok","Paul Bakewell","paul.bakewell@me.com","4114020073553","vanessa-bell","","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1744304910__img_8248__original.jpeg","35.176.71.72","London, England, United Kingdom","review-d31c2396-57e2-472d-97df-f873fe741f4f"

"Misleading Description & Poor Quality – 'Carolyn Knight' Bare Root Rose","I ordered the Carolyn Knight bare root rose believing in David Austin’s long-standing promise of Grade #1 quality, which clearly states that English shrub roses should have a minimum of three strong, well-ripened canes. What I received was one single strong cane and possibly one very weak secondary cane – completely below what is advertised.

What’s more disappointing is that the bare root rose arrived without any label, and the size and structure are much smaller and weaker than what’s shown on their website or expected from a premium supplier.

Their customer service replied that varieties with an “open or arching habit” may be sent with only two canes “on occasion” – but this is not reflected anywhere in their public product information. This type of inconsistent explanation sounds more like an excuse to cover poor grading or careless dispatch. If this is truly the case for ‘Carolyn Knight’, then they should update the website photos and product descriptions immediately to show realistic, accurate expectations of what customers will receive — not a healthy, full three-cane bare root as pictured.

I’ve spent years building a front garden focused entirely on David Austin roses, and have recommended them many times over other brands. Sadly, this experience raises serious doubts about their current quality control and honesty in customer communication.

David Austin is a respected name — but one misleading order like this can damage the trust of loyal customers forever.","1","2025-04-17 22:09:19 UTC","web","ok","ERIC NGO","ngovitronguk@gmail.com","4113818026065","carolyn-knight","","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1744927760__davidaustincarolynknight1__original.jpg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1744927761__davidaustincarolynknight2__original.jpg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1744927762__2025davidaustincustomerservicesreplies__original.png, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1744927764__2025aprildavidaustincomplaint1__original.png","2.216.15.179","Derby, England, United Kingdom","review-ef31054d-71d1-4603-89db-cfe54b8fc7e7"

"Unhealthy rose,don't buy.","Do not by from David Austin, my Claire Austin rose
came with aphids all over the buds and the leaves had rust and black spot. which could be passed onto plants nearby. They would not refund or exchange my money or plant.
At £33.00 the y should be sending healthy plants out.
I shouldn't have to treat the rose with insecticide and black spot remover,

"21 years old and still going! Best secateurs for me :)","My husband bought me a pair of these for my 35th Birthday. He has bought several pairs meanwhile for himself, all of which last very little time and blunt quickly. Meanwhile, my trusty Felco No6 keep going for me. Have had them sharpened once and just love them to death! Still going strong and getting ready for a new maintenance and sharpening routine this winter. So good, I have even bought the Felco snippers, which are also proving to be amazing. Trust me, these are well worth the cost - whether you go for the No6 or No2 or others … and will become your best friend in the garden - and make deadheading and pruning your roses an absolute joy.

"The Kings Rose","I ordered and payed for 3 Kings  Roses at the Chelsea Flower Show because I was gifting one to my daughter.
My two Roses were perfect but my daughters had Black spot and crispy brown leaves, plus she purchased a climber ?   for herself which was also marked.
Because these were delivered to her address and email I told her to contact David Austin which she did and was told it was alright to just remove the damage and everything would be fine, which I don’t think is good enough because I wouldn’t of bought them like that in a shop.
Also on David Austin video it mentioned that the Kings Rose was disease resistant.

I have bought dozens of David Austin Roses over that last 3 yrs and feel really disappointed with the comment, which makes me think should I really carry on buying from them.","3","2025-06-06 09:23:24 UTC","new-rre-flow","ok","Diana Leahy","dianadonaghy@msn.com","15268772315516","the-kings-rose","","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202333__1749201855379-62244e2a-d294-4de2-a514-34__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202334__1749201914738-291e4ed3-a023-4a66-b62f-9d__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202342__1749202018707-69802f71-69da-4b0f-bd30-f7__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202346__1749202060966-ae3a3490-7bea-4ab0-bacd-e4__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202336__1749201915835-63df0258-7bad-43d7-bb2b-13__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202337__1749201916377-69802f71-69da-4b0f-bd30-f7__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202338__1749201916896-24fc72fe-06b0-4166-956b-59__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202339__1749201917962-ae3a3490-7bea-4ab0-bacd-e4__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202340__1749201918600-62244e2a-d294-4de2-a514-34__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202344__1749202020367-63df0258-7bad-43d7-bb2b-13__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202345__1749202020872-62244e2a-d294-4de2-a514-34__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202343__1749202019925-24fc72fe-06b0-4166-956b-59__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202353__1749202310037-925d806f-748b-4aef-a0f4-b9__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202348__1749202120905-62244e2a-d294-4de2-a514-34__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202349__1749202122125-69802f71-69da-4b0f-bd30-f7__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202355__1749202312218-ae3a3490-7bea-4ab0-bacd-e4__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202350__1749202122617-63df0258-7bad-43d7-bb2b-13__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202352__1749202307373-e7b57c0b-65a1-4658-bf07-66__original.jpeg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749202354__1749202311300-c56a7bae-2229-468c-b80c-e8__original.jpeg","82.1.40.34","Leicester, England, United Kingdom","review-ab9e2203-90b1-4f1b-97c8-6f0a96a3c013"

Its a creamy white, not yellow. Its in year 2 and a narrow pot. First year SW wall second year NW wall and has thrived in both from BR. Year 2 it has tripled in buds. It forms clusters of frilly gorgeous blooms around 3 to 4cm. I cant smell so I cant comment on that.

"Excellent Rose","Arrived as a healthy bare root in November last year. Planted as per website instructions. It is June now and has many flowers. It is a very healthy plant and has no diseases so far, eventhough I’ve had some sawfly issues with my other new roses. It’s also wind resistant and due to the small size of blooms the petals remain steadfast which is a bonus in my windy exposed garden. The only drawback is that it hasn’t grown much in height. It is still a small low shrub and has not “climbed” up the fence. I am hoping to cover a large fence and I’m not sure how long this is going to take. Overall I am very happy with it. Easy to look after and I love the changing colours and hues of this rose.

"8 years on,  getting better and better","I never wrote a review when I received my rose as this was bare root,  received in winter.  Not much to write about. 
8 years on,  she's a real beauty. 

I got this rose after a visit to Sissinghurst. Madame Alfred Carriere was one of the first roses Vita Sackville West bought for her white garden.  I was so inspired.  

I got this rose to cover a rather bare, ugly,  new build extension next door imposed on me.  She really delivered.  I look forward to welcoming the flowers each year. 

Each year,  throughout the season,  I get the most beautiful white with pink blush roses nodding on green growth.  Today,  28 April,  I'm looking at 20 or 30 budding roses. 3 already blooming.  Thinking back to my Sissinghurst visit. 

I trim back hard in winter,  keeping my 'tree' structure.  The rose looks gorgeous year on year. Visited by bluetits and wrens, ladybirds and pollinators.

"Wonderful","I have about 50 DA Roses. I'm forever digging up more lawn to plant more. Started by buying singly to get as many as possible, though now buy in 3s and 4s and note the even better effect. G Oak was the first to be duplicated. Irresistible colour and scent and  very floriferous for me (south facing in Herefordshire). A little black spot doesn't seem to bother him and is probably mostly due to a nearby sickly beast, now removed.","5","2025-04-29 14:26:42 UTC","web","ok","IMW","jasmont7@gmail.com","4113844142161","gabriel-oak","","","","81.77.165.11","Blackwood, Wales, United Kingdom","review-87b1152f-7e1b-4aca-8dda-578e76e5c90b"

"Reservation on bare root plant growth","Bought a bare root one. After one year, it barely grew compared to 2 potted ones purchased separately which are striving (different types).  It was well looked after with plenty of compost, sunny spot, well watered in the summer months and fertilised to promote growth. Yet it is barely 14 inch high with very thin stems with no Autumn cut back being so small already ... David Austin tells me to wait and use more fertiliser but my view is that bare foot is a gamble. If you want 100% rapid success, opt for the potted plant. As an experienced gardener,  I will of course continue to nurture it but I am most disappointed.","2","2025-05-02 14:50:25 UTC","web","ok","Sandrine","wyatt21@protonmail.com","4113813405777","bathsheba","","","","18.134.207.119","City of London, England, United Kingdom","review-83a10292-3134-4f63-a430-ff47bd313baa"

I pruned it back quite hard this winter and it had grown much bushier and is blooming beautifully with plenty more buds developing. The flower heads are exquisite, almost peony like as they are opening. Such a beautiful array of colours from deep pink buds to the pale pink of the fully open blooms. The fragrance is wonderful too. Highly recommended!","5","2025-05-26 12:33:44 UTC","web","ok","Kitty","kirstenmnayler@gmail.com","3239494221905","scepter-d-isle","","","","86.160.177.43","Great Malvern, England, United Kingdom","review-c2220ead-598c-4d2d-b3cd-d2fa597f26dc"

I don’t ever write reviews usually but I just wanted to show how beautiful it’s become, and what a difference it can make to a bare wall.

"Beautiful Rose, Terrible Delivery","My issue with this order was not with the rose itself. It is a beautiful, healthy plant and exactly what I was expecting. My issue, unfortunately, was the terrible service provided by the courier, APC Delivery.
I first received an email telling me my rose was scheduled for delivery on the 30th of May. The day came and went with no updates and no rose. The delivery was delayed multiple times until it was finally “delivered” yesterday, the 4th of June. Naturally, I was worried about the condition the rose would be in, having been rattled around in a van for the best part of a week.
The delivery window yesterday again came and went and though the tracking showed the driver was nearby, it was almost an hour after the delivery slot that I received an email saying my rose had been delivered. However, it said the rose had been left in a safe place, the Back Door, as instructed. I made no such instruction, as we don’t have a back door accessible from the street. It then transpired that it had been delivered to an entirely different house on an entirely different road. This is baffling to me, as the address was correct and clearly printed on the box. I then had to go out looking for the house the rose had gone to, trying to match the delivery photo and map location. I had to go into someone else’s front garden, up to their door to get the box, all the while worried that someone would come out and accuse me of stealing their post.
This is hands down the absolute worst delivery experience I’ve ever had and unfortunately would definitely make me think twice about ordering from David Austin again. It’s such a shame, as when I eventually got the rose it was beautiful (despite being a little battered and bruised from being in a van for days) and my issues are nothing to do with David Austin themselves. I would really urge you to rethink using this carrier if this is in any way a common issue, as it really ruins the experience of buying such top quality plants from a great nursery.
I’m glad I have such a beautiful rose now, but I almost definitely would shop elsewhere for any more after such a frustrating and sloppy delivery service.","3","2025-06-05 14:21:33 UTC","new-rre-flow","ok","Sorcha Flynn","sorchanf@gmail.com","4114020073553","vanessa-bell","","","","80.2.89.176","Fulham, England, United Kingdom","review-6a0e4b14-5608-4582-822d-5d6cdd50019c"

"Simply divine","I came across this rose in a garden centre and fell in love; it had to come home with me. I was confused though, because I'd never heard of this variety before, and when I looked it up here, realised why. It's listed as a ""red"" rose, which I would never look at. In reality it is actually a vivid, rich, deep pink - but definitely not red. Smell is rather light but beautiful.","5","2025-06-14 10:09:39 UTC","web","ok","Hollie S","hollie.scott@gmail.com","4114013847633","thomas-a-becket","","","","86.132.98.171","Ipswich, England, United Kingdom","review-f7a42211-9573-466f-bdc7-3322355eaf0b"

In the picture you’ll see it’s next to one of my Gertrude Jekyll’s. That’s been trained for about 8 years and is glorious. The Summer Song has one year training and the colour is so striking that an a couple of years they will be competing.

"Sadly arrived covered in aphids","This is my third DA rose and previously I’ve bought bare roots that take 2-3 years to really establish and put on a show so I decided to splash out for my 40th and ordered a potted rose that would be potted up and located in my new extension/greenhouse style room. 

It arrived on time and already with buds but it was covered in aphids. Not just a few but COVERED.   It’s been an absolute nightmare trying to rid the new growth of them and as such I’ve had to quarantine the rose longer than I’d usually have to with an in bud plant to stop the spreading of aphids to my other plants. Sadly it’s attracting ants if put outside for any length of time. 

I’ve tried EVERY trick in the non pesticide book to rid the plant of the green life sucking nasties but they just take over after a few days as another round of missed eggs hatch.  Obviously my outdoor plants get greenfly but the beautiful lacewings, ladybirds, greedy wasps and sparrows those care of the issues but as this plant is at the delicate stage birds would knock the new growth off and I’m not inviting wasps in.  

I will persist but so will the greenfly it seems. Fingers crossed I win.","2","2025-06-02 11:43:01 UTC","web","ok","Midlands mess maker ","ickleelle@hotmail.com","7085003898961","dannahue","","","","82.69.8.82","Portsmouth, England, United Kingdom","review-4f0f12e3-cd77-4cfd-a68a-0592ad788647"

"Beautiful but not healthy","Planted this rose in 2022 against the east facing wall. It is a very fast grower, however, suffers from white mildew (none of my other roses do), which results in curving leaves and damaged flowers. Fungicides do not seem to help for long, eventually mildew spreads all over the plant, and due to the size it is impossible to spray the whole rose anyway.  Also more of an aphid magnet compared to other roses. Flowers are fragrant and long lasting, but as a slight downside - petals do not fall off, flowers just turn brown and dry on the plant making it look unattractive, as deadheading it is very difficult due to it's size.","2","2025-06-10 19:22:58 UTC","web","ok","Anna Smith ","anyavscott@hotmail.co.uk","4113880023121","paul-noel","","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749583378__img_20240601_095525_edit_780717467287119__original.jpg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749583380__screenshot_20250610_200116__original.jpg, https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1749583382__img_20240520_120137__original.jpg","84.67.212.88","Reading, England, United Kingdom","review-b997ec2a-0de8-4855-9986-524d5d99828a"

The three stars are because the flowers themselves are a bit…well, pathetic. The colour variation isn’t particularly noticeable and the blooms last for under two days. Well cared for and watering at night throughout this dry period. 

By contrast, I bought a Gabriel Oak variant at the same time. Beautiful, vibrant blooms which have been lasting for five days at a time.   And the scent is divine.

"Okay","The flowers on this have gone very white ( almost yellowish white though so not a nice colour) in the heat wave we've been having which is disappointing. I wanted a pink rose to stand out against my brick wall but this one has really faded in an extreme way. I'm.hoping it will.turn pink again when the heatwave subsides. I also bought a Sceptred Isle rose which has stayed a beautiful pink colour and which hasn't been affected by the heat. I'm not sure why the Generous Gardener rose would change so drastically in colour with heat when my others haven't.","3","2025-07-01 09:55:29 UTC","web","ok","Brittany ","brittanyturner09@gmail.com","4113820778577","the-generous-gardener-climbing-rose","","","","217.155.105.44","Leighton Buzzard, England, United Kingdom","review-c72048ef-b15d-4a8f-8cf9-2752f27ab645"

"Stunning Shrub Rose","I am so pleased with my first DA Rose
Purchase … I bought as a plant and kept in a pot last summer for its first year feeding it with organic seaweed weekly during the summer. I had about 10 flowers (cool pale pink) on dark green glossy foliage. In Oct 24 I transferred to a south facing (clay-ish) border about 1.5m in and it tripled in size this spring and the first flush was  in early June stunning … double the blooms of the previous season. It just needed a bit of support as the foliage is quite immature to hold the huge blooms … which I am sure with strength over time.  We are end of 1st week in July and we have more new foliage and more buds forming up.     So very pleased …. That I have gone on to buy 8 more  DA roses - a mix of bare roots and plants … and I love Desdemona that I am learning about this season.   Just watching them like a hawk with our hot season 2025  here in UK.  P all roses recieved sustained release granulesi. March and end of June with organic seaweed liquid feeds weekly from end of April.","5","2025-07-06 08:39:54 UTC","web","ok","Clare","clare@fitzrobinson.com","4113811046481","the-ancient-mariner","","","","82.2.58.42","Nottingham, England, United Kingdom","review-45cfda67-55cb-45ef-9c8f-7602777015e7"

However the leaves have been completed eaten by something and my other roses are untouched.","5","2025-07-06 16:49:13 UTC","web","ok","Rachel rosie","rachel_louise88@hotmail.co.uk","7091059195985","penelope-lively","","","","92.40.179.51","Hackney, England, United Kingdom","review-26b03452-fc9e-4672-a22d-6ef7809dcfc7"
"Absolute must have","This is such a wonderful rose. It really needs to be seen in person. I've had tall healthy growth and constant roses from a bare root. Definite one of my top favourites due to its health and pearlescent blooms","5","2025-07-06 16:52:56 UTC","web","ok","Rachel rosie","rachel_louise88@hotmail.co.uk","3239494025297","the-lark-ascending","","","","92.40.179.51","Hackney, England, United Kingdom","review-ef9c4ec7-f18d-469a-ae08-85787aef038c"
"Gorgeous rich colour","This is such a beautiful colour, and the colour doesn't fade or change at all as the blooms age. Each rose flower is a beautiful shape and I feel that the description is correct in saying the the blooms have a very good resistance to rain. It stood out at the David Austin gardens as being one of the most vivid peach/oranges. Gorgeous!","5","2025-07-07 06:13:48 UTC","web","ok","Ruth","caroline@quinton.me.uk","4113834836049","dame-judi-dench","","","","109.152.209.45","Dumfries, Scotland, United Kingdom","review-b6c176bc-77f3-48b8-b9c7-cbbe72c3cdb7"
"Love the flowers","Bought mine bare root in April ‘25 and planted in clay soil in my garden. I’ve kept her watered through the very dry weather and have been feeding a liquid feed every few days. She’s responded beautifully, a lovely healthy shrub. The photo is of her first flowers.
All roses need extra TLC in their first couple of years at least - make sure EB doesn’t lack for light, water or nutrients and she will reward you!","5","2025-07-07 13:26:22 UTC","web","ok","Harriet","commerce-he@posteo.co.uk","7474704941137","emma-bridgewater","","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/me.judge.review-images/david-austin-roses-uk/1751894782__cb23e868-60d8-4ab1-a506-2d557f4c56ed__original.jpeg","185.241.224.245","Pont-y-clun, Wales, United Kingdom","review-976fe2bf-051a-4a9e-be75-0be61f800d15"
