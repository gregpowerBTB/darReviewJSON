    "body": "We planted this beautiful climber against a wall to the side of our patio area. The wall is painted terracotta, so the cream-coloured flowers look absolutely stunning against the darker backdrop. The flowers are quite long-lasting too and just kept coming all summer into Autumn last year. With their delicate scent - they are perfect on a summer's evening next to our outdoor seating area.",

I really look forward to training it over the top of the pergola. I especially love this rose for the shape of the flowers. They also make a gorgeous cut flower-I hope the photo illustrates this!",
