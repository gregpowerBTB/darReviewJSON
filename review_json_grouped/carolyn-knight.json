    "title": "Misleading Description & Poor Quality \u2013 'Carolyn Knight' Bare Root Rose",
    "body": "I ordered the Carolyn Knight bare root rose believing in David Austin\u2019s long-standing promise of Grade #1 quality, which clearly states that English shrub roses should have a minimum of three strong, well-ripened canes. What I received was one single strong cane and possibly one very weak secondary cane \u2013 completely below what is advertised.\n\nWhat\u2019s more disappointing is that the bare root rose arrived without any label, and the size and structure are much smaller and weaker than what\u2019s shown on their website or expected from a premium supplier.\n\nTheir customer service replied that varieties with an \u201copen or arching habit\u201d may be sent with only two canes \u201con occasion\u201d \u2013 but this is not reflected anywhere in their public product information. This type of inconsistent explanation sounds more like an excuse to cover poor grading or careless dispatch. If this is truly the case for \u2018Carolyn Knight\u2019, then they should update the website photos and product descriptions immediately to show realistic, accurate expectations of what customers will receive \u2014 not a healthy, full three-cane bare root as pictured.\n\nI\u2019ve spent years building a front garden focused entirely on David Austin roses, and have recommended them many times over other brands. Sadly, this experience raises serious doubts about their current quality control and honesty in customer communication.\n\nDavid Austin is a respected name \u2014 but one misleading order like this can damage the trust of loyal customers forever.",

    "title": "Exceeded Expectations \u2013 Stunning Rose with Exceptional Fragrance!",
    "body": "I purchased a bare root \u201cCarolyn Knight\u201d rose last autumn, and it has far exceeded my expectations. It has grown into a strong, upright plant with lush, deep green foliage that looks incredibly healthy and vibrant. But the real star is the bloom \u2013 absolutely breathtaking! The colors are even more striking than depicted on the website, with captivating hues of orange, yellow, and apricot that create a stunning display.\nAnd the fragrance \u2013 simply exquisite! It\u2019s rich, warm, and utterly delightful, filling the garden with a scent that\u2019s both nostalgic and refreshing. I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with how beautifully it has flourished. Highly recommend to any rose enthusiast!",
