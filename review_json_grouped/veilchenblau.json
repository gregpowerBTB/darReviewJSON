    "title": "Outstanding rose!",
    "body": "This spectacular rambler covers the rose arch with a mass of blooms every year. The small,  delicate flowers display gradient of colour from pink to deep reddish-purple, with bright yellow stamens.   The rose is permanently covered in bees,  heavy with the nectar. The scent can only be described as closer to Lily of the valley than a rose: it is gentle and fills the air on a warm day.",
