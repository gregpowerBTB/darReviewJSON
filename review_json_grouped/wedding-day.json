    "body": "I was bought this rose as a wedding gift nine years ago. It took a move from the original place we planted it but it\u2019s now very happy and forms part of a mixed hedge. It needs you to be brutal and it\u2019ll reward you. Absolutely love the way the flowers change colour and still very thankful for the gift :)",
