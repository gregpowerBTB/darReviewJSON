    "body": "Desdemona is one of my all time favourite roses, and my enthusiasm for it has spread to several of my neighbours so it is a delight to walk down my street in summer when it is in flower, and I often see complete strangers leaning over the garden wall to get a waft of the glorious scent when it is in flower - and it flowers for a long season. It is one of the healthiest roses I have ever grown, and it is a perfect size: it has a strong presence but remains fairly well behaved and does not jostle other plants in the same bed. There is something exquisite about the blush pink buds opening to white as they mature, and I love the subtlety and nostalgia of the old rose scent, not too sweet, not too sharp, and with a heady depth of fragrance that takes me right back to childhood and my mothers garden. I plant it everywhere - see one I planted five years ago under a pavilion in a garden in Kensington.",
