    "body": "Always been a fan of David Austin, well, who isnt? I have many including this one at the back of a rose border and there is something quite special, she actually glows an almost neon quality to her colours. Quite bright against darker leaves around her and the range of pinks is lovely. A good fragrance but not the most powerful i have. She gets to about 5ft tall and 2 and bit foot wide adding lovely colour to an otherwise dark patch in the border. Thank you.",

It does well in a pot (40cmx40cm - ish) and in the ground as part of a mixed border.  The stems are strong also.",
