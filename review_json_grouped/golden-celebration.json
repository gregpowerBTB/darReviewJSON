    "body": "As with all David Austin roses, Golden Celebration is a strong grower with beautiful flowers. Mine was to replace a very old 'Golden Wedding' rose inherited from my parents' garden. It had been a present for their 50th wedding anniversary, but eventually succumbed to old age. Golden Celebration is doing well, considering I planted it in the same place. One problem is that with all the rain last year, its growth was sappy, and some of the long stems, once flowering, bent right over, even to the ground. The flowers were quite large, with a mild scent, and long lasting, and of a gorgeous gold.",

    "body": "I purchased this for myself as it woukd have been my late husbands and I Golden wedding. It was very small but had several flowers but also black spot which despite treating promptly lost all its leaves. I feed the following spring with uncle Tom's feed and it flowered but once again black spot dropped all leaves. I did email but was told probably wet weather caused it. I was greatly disappointed as I have a garden full of your roses but this one didn't meet my expectations I'm afraid",
