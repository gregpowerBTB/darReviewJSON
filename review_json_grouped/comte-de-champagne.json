    "body": "This rose glows with a beautiful champagne gold fading to cream and almost white over time.                     Planted in a large pot, it flowers profusely in my garden.\nFragrance is delicate but adds to the joy of the simple stunning petals. \nI have a lovely range of DA roses but this one greats me with its glow first thing in the morning.",
