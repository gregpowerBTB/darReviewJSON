In the first year the leaf cutter bees found it and they are here every year. It is covered in various bees, hoverflies and other pollinators. The scent is lovely. Great quality plant.",

It is growing in a shady spot, but has climbed into the sun and is smothered in one lovely burst of bloom in summer and very attractive to bees.  A healthy and trouble-free plant - I couldn't be more delighted.",

It may be a bit big for the arch it's growing on but who cares...let's see where she decides to ramble to.  A healthy rose which didn't mind being moved in it's first year. Really pleased.",
