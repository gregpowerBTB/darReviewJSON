    "title": "Excellent Rose",
    "body": "Arrived as a healthy bare root in November last year. Planted as per website instructions. It is June now and has many flowers. It is a very healthy plant and has no diseases so far, eventhough I\u2019ve had some sawfly issues with my other new roses. It\u2019s also wind resistant and due to the small size of blooms the petals remain steadfast which is a bonus in my windy exposed garden. The only drawback is that it hasn\u2019t grown much in height. It is still a small low shrub and has not \u201cclimbed\u201d up the fence. I am hoping to cover a large fence and I\u2019m not sure how long this is going to take. Overall I am very happy with it. Easy to look after and I love the changing colours and hues of this rose. Scent very light.",

We couldn't be more pleased.",
