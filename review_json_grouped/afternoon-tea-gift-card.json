    "body": "Bought for my dad\u2019s 86th birthday for him and his wife and he was delighted with it. I opted for the \u00a32.95 card delivery. It arrived within a few days so I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t bother with fast delivery costs. I\u2019m glad I spent the \u00a33 for the hard copy of the voucher, as it is a lovely, tasteful, well designed card which is much more personal than an email print out. The voucher lasts for two years so the recipient has lots of choice about when to go. They\u2019re planning their visit for June/ July when the roses should be at their best. It\u2019s a lovely thing to look forward to for the summer (especially in the current weather with snow on the ground)! I hope they will enjoy it.",
