    "body": "Beautiful shape, colour and smell (plenty of buds too) however, it seems as though the blooms are much too large and heavy for the stems. It is floppy in habit and I have struggled to get it to grow anymore than 50cm tall and wide. No issue with any other DA roses that have performed beautifully. I would buy this rose and keep it if you want a staggered effect in a border, just stake it.",
