    "body": "What I love about Eustacia Vye. The rose is a good healthy grower, yet stays more compact than some other DA varieties, forming a nice rounding shrub of a medium size. It blooms well, repeat is slower than on some other DA varieties, but its health makes up for the slower repeat. I love Eustacia's flowers, they are constantly changing in form and colour. In sunny conditions the flowers are paling to peach colours, while on cloudier days the blooms are a warm pink. It has a wonderful fruity fragrance. I would definitely recommend this rose.",
