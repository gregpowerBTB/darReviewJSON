It is planted close to a pergola so this year I pruned and trained it up one of the pergola pillers and it has romped up to the top in one season,  over 8 foot tall! Maybe sell it as a climber?   In the picture you\u2019ll see it\u2019s next to one of my Gertrude Jekyll\u2019s. That\u2019s been trained for about 8 years and is glorious. The Summer Song has one year training and the colour is so striking that an a couple of years they will be competing.   The bush roses in front are Princess Alexandra of Kent with the Generous Gardener at the back of the pergola.",

I added the rooting fungi, more rose food, and fed it Maxicrop for roots. Now it is shooting up some strong and upright canes, where the roses don\u2019t flop. The scent has not kicked in yet but it has only been 6 months since I did all this. Hopefully next year will be better.",
