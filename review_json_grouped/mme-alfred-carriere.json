Not much to write about. \n8 years on,  she's a real beauty. \n\nI got this rose after a visit to Sissinghurst. Madame Alfred Carriere was one of the first roses Vita Sackville West bought for her white garden.  I was so inspired.  \n\nI got this rose to cover a rather bare, ugly,  new build extension next door imposed on me.  She really delivered.  I look forward to welcoming the flowers each year. \n\nEach year,  throughout the season,  I get the most beautiful white with pink blush roses nodding on green growth.  Today,  28 April,  I'm looking at 20 or 30 budding roses. 3 already blooming.  Thinking back to my Sissinghurst visit. \n\nI trim back hard in winter,  keeping my 'tree' structure.  The rose looks gorgeous year on year. Visited by bluetits and wrens, ladybirds and pollinators.  Thank you Madame Alfred and Vita S-W.",
