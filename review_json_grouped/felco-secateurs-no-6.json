    "body": "My husband bought me a pair of these for my 35th Birthday. He has bought several pairs meanwhile for himself, all of which last very little time and blunt quickly. Meanwhile, my trusty Felco No6 keep going for me. Have had them sharpened once and just love them to death! Still going strong and getting ready for a new maintenance and sharpening routine this winter. So good, I have even bought the Felco snippers, which are also proving to be amazing. Trust me, these are well worth the cost - whether you go for the No6 or No2 or others \u2026 and will become your best friend in the garden - and make deadheading and pruning your roses an absolute joy. \n\n(PS: I did not buy them from David Austin Roses so a very sincere review, although I/we own several DA Roses!).",
