    "body": "We have 2 of these growing in the back garden onto a collapsing arch while one is in front in a large pot which will go over the front door when mature. \nThe smell is divine and has a hint of citrus/ honeysuckle.  There is a mayhem of beautiful fragrances in my garden with Crimson Glory, honeysuckle,  mock orange, lavender all growing in close proximity to each other.  It keeps on producing large flowers all the way from early spring till the end of summer and beyond.",
