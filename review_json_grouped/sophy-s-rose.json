    "body": "I have had this rose in my garden for 14 years and it has never disappointed. The colour is just amazing, being a very saturated vibrant deep fuschia pink. Buds open looking like it\u2019s going to be a red rose but quickly changes to it\u2019s true colour. If you like a pop of colour in your garden you can\u2019t go far wrong. Very healthy with an upright habit. Bees have been known to sleep in the deep petals overnight.",
