    "body": "The most wonderful rose! Mine is now nearly 7 ft and planted at the end of a hedge of Royal Jubilee roses and abolutely full of blooms. Passers-by stop and tell me how beautiful the rose is and how wonderful the fragrance. Some have even taken photographs and sent to a relative with the message: \"Wish you could smell this too!\". She is an old rose so does not repeat flower, but whilst she lasts she is one of the most magnificent roses I have. Highly recommend.",
