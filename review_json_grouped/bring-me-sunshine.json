Since then, it has absolutely thrived \u2014 full of life and bursting with the most gorgeous, sunshine-colored flowers.\n\nEvery bloom brings warmth to my heart and feels like a little message from her. It\u2019s a stunning rose, healthy and vibrant, and I\u2019m so grateful for the joy it brings to my garden. Thank you, David Austin, for such a meaningful and beautiful rose.\n\n\u2014 In loving memory of Neepy \ud83c\udf3c\ud83d\udc9b",
