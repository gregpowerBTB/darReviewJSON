The flowers are a lovely deep pink and repeat flowering, often still going when the others have finished blooming. I've used it also as a climbing rose screen on a fence and gives good coverage. Need to monitor for black spot but that is all roses now with how wet it always is. Seems very resilient to rust. A steady performer year on year.",

Even in the pouring rain we are having this week, she shines bright. My photo is from first flowers and she has tonnes more since this was taken.",
