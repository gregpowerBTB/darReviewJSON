Not just a few but COVERED.   It\u2019s been an absolute nightmare trying to rid the new growth of them and as such I\u2019ve had to quarantine the rose longer than I\u2019d usually have to with an in bud plant to stop the spreading of aphids to my other plants. Sadly it\u2019s attracting ants if put outside for any length of time. \n\nI\u2019ve tried EVERY trick in the non pesticide book to rid the plant of the green life sucking nasties but they just take over after a few days as another round of missed eggs hatch.  Obviously my outdoor plants get greenfly but the beautiful lacewings, ladybirds, greedy wasps and sparrows those care of the issues but as this plant is at the delicate stage birds would knock the new growth off and I\u2019m not inviting wasps in.  \n\nI will persist but so will the greenfly it seems.
