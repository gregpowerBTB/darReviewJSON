    "title": "Beautifully Made",
    "body": "I ordered the 4.5L watering can and I am so impressed with the quality of it. The longer spout will help get into the base of my rose shrubs. The price on the DA website is fantastic - do your research. This is a must piece of kit for your garden, especially beautiful roses.  I now have two Haws watering cans, they are built to last and worth the investment.",
