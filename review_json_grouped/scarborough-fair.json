Just in desperate need of immediate attention. Very embarrassing and wouldn't consider ordering again if this is the state things are going to arrive in.",

Individually they may not look terribly special, but en masse they are superb and have rapidly become one of my favourites. In December I had to insist that they took a rest, and removed a few shoots that were still doing their best to flower.",
