    "body": "I love this rose, the blooms are huge, magenta pink turning more purple as they age and the fragrance is strong. It will need some support in my opinion as it has a more floppy nature with the stems not quite strong enough to hold the bloom upright so lends itself well for a tree as the blooms can be more easily seen than as a shrub.",
