Within days it had started its vigorous growth. All through the summer and way into the autumn it flowered enthusiastically with well perfumed, beautiful blooms. It is planted in a sheltered spot and I was a little anxious that it might not like the lack of direct sunlight, but it seems very happy. I am looking forward to those summer evenings when I can sit out in my \u201a\u00c4\u00fatranquil spot\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with my glass of something nice and bask in the gently scent of my favourite rose - I do have many many DA roses!",
