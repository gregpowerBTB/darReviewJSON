    "body": "This is my favourite David Austin rose bush ever, and I saw a popular YouTuber rate it as number one on his top 50 roses this year too. It makes such a statement viewed across the garden, full blossoms of the most perfect shade of pink, and the picture of health. It is not a small rose bush, but everyone with a medium sized or larger garden should have a Hyde Hall!",
