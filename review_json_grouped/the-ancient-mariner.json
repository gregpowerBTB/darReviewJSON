It is planted in my sunny garden border and is pruned each year and just keeps going from strength to strength.  We have looked forward to it\u2019s amazing blooms each year and it has not disappointed.",

    "title": "Stunning Shrub Rose",
    "body": "I am so pleased with my first DA Rose\nPurchase \u2026 I bought as a plant and kept in a pot last summer for its first year feeding it with organic seaweed weekly during the summer. I had about 10 flowers (cool pale pink) on dark green glossy foliage. In Oct 24 I transferred to a south facing (clay-ish) border about 1.5m in and it tripled in size this spring and the first flush was  in early June stunning \u2026 double the blooms of the previous season. It just needed a bit of support as the foliage is quite immature to hold the huge blooms \u2026 which I am sure with strength over time.  We are end of 1st week in July and we have more new foliage and more buds forming up.     So very pleased \u2026. That I have gone on to buy 8 more  DA roses - a mix of bare roots and plants \u2026 and I love Desdemona that I am learning about this season.   Just watching them like a hawk with our hot season 2025  here in UK.  P all roses recieved sustained release granulesi. March and end of June with organic seaweed liquid feeds weekly from end of April.",
