The scent is delicate, sometimes only fragrant on a warm summers day. We have found that the Olivia is a delicate rose bush, she has yet to find her vigor, at 3 years old she is still flimsy and her stems too weak to hold a full bush shape. This year again we.have pruned her well, wedding out any canes less than a pencil thickness in hope of new vigor. Our emily bronze, eustacia vye and Lichfield angel have flourished more so than Olivia. I'm still really hoping for a beautiful Olivia hedge. \n Next on my list sceptre isle, lady shalott and POAK.",

Last year it produced a number of strong healthy new stems and a good quantity of flowers so this year I am looking forward to seeing it in it's full glory.\n Olivia Rose Austin is now one of 12 David Austin roses in my garden all of which are doing extremely well and fill the garden with colour and fragrance especially on a warm summer's day.",
