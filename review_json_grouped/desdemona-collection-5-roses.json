    "body": "I planted 5 bare roots under a window in our house in March, and although they are a slower growing variety, and the soil conditions were less than ideal (we added some help when we planted them), they have grown beautifully, establishing well, and have produced the most stunning blooms. The scent is so strong that it travels through the house when we have the window open. They were my first David Austin roses, and I have since purchased another 3 shrubs and am planning another hedge.",
