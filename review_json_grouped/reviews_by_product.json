So much so I've bought another to put near my front door to grow up an obelisk and cant wait for summer and to be met with its smell when I get home. The flowers are a lovely deep pink and repeat flowering, often still going when the others have finished blooming. I've used it also as a climbing rose screen on a fence and gives good coverage. Need to monitor for black spot but that is all roses now with how wet it always is. Seems very resilient to rust. A steady performer year on year.",

It’s a stunning rose, healthy and vibrant, and I’m so grateful for the joy it brings to my garden. Thank you, David Austin, for such a meaningful and beautiful rose.\n\n— In loving memory of Neepy 🌼💛",

It arrived within a few days so I’m glad I didn’t bother with fast delivery costs. I’m glad I spent the £3 for the hard copy of the voucher, as it is a lovely, tasteful, well designed card which is much more personal than an email print out. The voucher lasts for two years so the recipient has lots of choice about when to go. They’re planning their visit for June/ July when the roses should be at their best. It’s a lovely thing to look forward to for the summer (especially in the current weather with snow on the ground)! I hope they will enjoy it.",

This year again we.have pruned her well, wedding out any canes less than a pencil thickness in hope of new vigor. Our emily bronze, eustacia vye and Lichfield angel have flourished more so than Olivia. I'm still really hoping for a beautiful Olivia hedge. \n Next on my list sceptre isle, lady shalott and POAK.",

Last year it produced a number of strong healthy new stems and a good quantity of flowers so this year I am looking forward to seeing it in it's full glory.\n Olivia Rose Austin is now one of 12 David Austin roses in my garden all of which are doing extremely well and fill the garden with colour and fragrance especially on a warm summer's day.",

It is one of the healthiest roses I have ever grown, and it is a perfect size: it has a strong presence but remains fairly well behaved and does not jostle other plants in the same bed. There is something exquisite about the blush pink buds opening to white as they mature, and I love the subtlety and nostalgia of the old rose scent, not too sweet, not too sharp, and with a heady depth of fragrance that takes me right back to childhood and my mothers garden. I plant it everywhere - see one I planted five years ago under a pavilion in a garden in Kensington.",

So I ordered a new potted one once I'd moved and planted her up into a large container a month ago.  The first bud has just opened with many more to come :-)",

Within days it had started its vigorous growth. All through the summer and way into the autumn it flowered enthusiastically with well perfumed, beautiful blooms. It is planted in a sheltered spot and I was a little anxious that it might not like the lack of direct sunlight, but it seems very happy. I am looking forward to those summer evenings when I can sit out in my ‚Äútranquil spot‚Äù with my glass of something nice and bask in the gently scent of my favourite rose - I do have many many DA roses!",

It blooms well, repeat is slower than on some other DA varieties, but its health makes up for the slower repeat. I love Eustacia's flowers, they are constantly changing in form and colour. In sunny conditions the flowers are paling to peach colours, while on cloudier days the blooms are a warm pink. It has a wonderful fruity fragrance. I would definitely recommend this rose.",

In the picture you’ll see it’s next to one of my Gertrude Jekyll’s. That’s been trained for about 8 years and is glorious. The Summer Song has one year training and the colour is so striking that an a couple of years they will be competing.   The bush roses in front are Princess Alexandra of Kent with the Generous Gardener at the back of the pergola.",

We planted it 2years ago in July, and I followed the tutorial videos on planting and training a climbing rose on the David Austen website. I don’t ever write reviews usually but I just wanted to show how beautiful it’s become, and what a difference it can make to a bare wall. It really does bring me joy every time I look out of our bay window now. It also repeatedly flowers for such a long time (end of May-October). You can’t go wrong with this gorgeous rose (because even I’ve managed to do this!).",

Not just a few but COVERED.   It’s been an absolute nightmare trying to rid the new growth of them and as such I’ve had to quarantine the rose longer than I’d usually have to with an in bud plant to stop the spreading of aphids to my other plants. Sadly it’s attracting ants if put outside for any length of time. \n\nI’ve tried EVERY trick in the non pesticide book to rid the plant of the green life sucking nasties but they just take over after a few days as another round of missed eggs hatch.  Obviously my outdoor plants get greenfly but the beautiful lacewings, ladybirds, greedy wasps and sparrows those care of the issues but as this plant is at the delicate stage birds would knock the new growth off and I’m not inviting wasps in.  \n\nI will persist but so will the greenfly it seems. Fingers crossed I win.",

The flowers are beautiful..the faintest peach, creamy rather than pale orange, the gorgeous scent and the petals are tight and don't go all floppy in rain. Also can be a small climber if you want to let it grow. I have bought 2 for family as gifts and plan to purchase another.Highly recommend",

It had been a present for their 50th wedding anniversary, but eventually succumbed to old age. Golden Celebration is doing well, considering I planted it in the same place. One problem is that with all the rain last year, its growth was sappy, and some of the long stems, once flowering, bent right over, even to the ground. The flowers were quite large, with a mild scent, and long lasting, and of a gorgeous gold.",

Yet it is barely 14 inch high with very thin stems with no Autumn cut back being so small already ... David Austin tells me to wait and use more fertiliser but my view is that bare foot is a gamble. If you want 100% rapid success, opt for the potted plant. As an experienced gardener,  I will of course continue to nurture it but I am most disappointed.",

Word of warning - this is the thorniest rose I've ever planted, the stems covered in many little thorns.  A small price to pay for what I hope will be a beautiful rose bush.",

The colour variation isn’t particularly noticeable and the blooms last for under two days. Well cared for and watering at night throughout this dry period. \n\nBy contrast, I bought a Gabriel Oak variant at the same time. Beautiful, vibrant blooms which have been lasting for five days at a time.   And the scent is divine. \n\nGiven how expensive the Bridgewater rose is, I wouldn’t recommend it. Not awful, but not great either.",

        "body": "I’ve got 2 Vanessa Bell roses growing in 2 large pot, and they have been absolutely lovely. The buds open with a soft blush of pink and turn into elegant, medium-sized cups in generous clusters. The colour is gentle and cheerful—pale yellow fading to white at the edges, with a rich yellow centre that glows, especially in the early morning light.\n\nThe fragrance is one of the best things about it—fresh and slightly unusual, like green tea with a bit of lemon and honey. It’s subtle but noticeable, especially when the sun’s been on it for a bit.\n\nEven in a container, it’s grown into a tidy, upright shrub with a nice full shape. It’s stayed healthy and blooms reliably, which is always a bonus when growing in pots.\n\nI also really like that it’s named after Vanessa Bell, the artist and sister of Virginia Woolf—it adds a bit of character and history to the garden, which I appreciate.\n\nAll in all, a beautifully scented, easy-to-care-for rose that looks stunning in a container. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone short on space or wanting to brighten up a patio or balcony.",

        "body": "My issue with this order was not with the rose itself. It is a beautiful, healthy plant and exactly what I was expecting. My issue, unfortunately, was the terrible service provided by the courier, APC Delivery.\nI first received an email telling me my rose was scheduled for delivery on the 30th of May. The day came and went with no updates and no rose. The delivery was delayed multiple times until it was finally “delivered” yesterday, the 4th of June. Naturally, I was worried about the condition the rose would be in, having been rattled around in a van for the best part of a week.\nThe delivery window yesterday again came and went and though the tracking showed the driver was nearby, it was almost an hour after the delivery slot that I received an email saying my rose had been delivered. However, it said the rose had been left in a safe place, the Back Door, as instructed. I made no such instruction, as we don’t have a back door accessible from the street. It then transpired that it had been delivered to an entirely different house on an entirely different road. This is baffling to me, as the address was correct and clearly printed on the box. I then had to go out looking for the house the rose had gone to, trying to match the delivery photo and map location. I had to go into someone else’s front garden, up to their door to get the box, all the while worried that someone would come out and accuse me of stealing their post.\nThis is hands down the absolute worst delivery experience I’ve ever had and unfortunately would definitely make me think twice about ordering from David Austin again. It’s such a shame, as when I eventually got the rose it was beautiful (despite being a little battered and bruised from being in a van for days) and my issues are nothing to do with David Austin themselves. I would really urge you to rethink using this carrier if this is in any way a common issue, as it really ruins the experience of buying such top quality plants from a great nursery.\nI’m glad I have such a beautiful rose now, but I almost definitely would shop elsewhere for any more after such a frustrating and sloppy delivery service.",

        "body": "I ordered the Carolyn Knight bare root rose believing in David Austin’s long-standing promise of Grade #1 quality, which clearly states that English shrub roses should have a minimum of three strong, well-ripened canes. What I received was one single strong cane and possibly one very weak secondary cane – completely below what is advertised.\n\nWhat’s more disappointing is that the bare root rose arrived without any label, and the size and structure are much smaller and weaker than what’s shown on their website or expected from a premium supplier.\n\nTheir customer service replied that varieties with an “open or arching habit” may be sent with only two canes “on occasion” – but this is not reflected anywhere in their public product information. This type of inconsistent explanation sounds more like an excuse to cover poor grading or careless dispatch. If this is truly the case for ‘Carolyn Knight’, then they should update the website photos and product descriptions immediately to show realistic, accurate expectations of what customers will receive — not a healthy, full three-cane bare root as pictured.\n\nI’ve spent years building a front garden focused entirely on David Austin roses, and have recommended them many times over other brands. Sadly, this experience raises serious doubts about their current quality control and honesty in customer communication.\n\nDavid Austin is a respected name — but one misleading order like this can damage the trust of loyal customers forever.",

It has grown into a strong, upright plant with lush, deep green foliage that looks incredibly healthy and vibrant. But the real star is the bloom – absolutely breathtaking! The colors are even more striking than depicted on the website, with captivating hues of orange, yellow, and apricot that create a stunning display.\nAnd the fragrance – simply exquisite! It’s rich, warm, and utterly delightful, filling the garden with a scent that’s both nostalgic and refreshing. I couldn’t be more thrilled with how beautifully it has flourished. Highly recommend to any rose enthusiast!",

Still going strong and getting ready for a new maintenance and sharpening routine this winter. So good, I have even bought the Felco snippers, which are also proving to be amazing. Trust me, these are well worth the cost - whether you go for the No6 or No2 or others … and will become your best friend in the garden - and make deadheading and pruning your roses an absolute joy. \n\n(PS: I did not buy them from David Austin Roses so a very sincere review, although I/we own several DA Roses!).",

Not much to write about. \n8 years on,  she's a real beauty. \n\nI got this rose after a visit to Sissinghurst. Madame Alfred Carriere was one of the first roses Vita Sackville West bought for her white garden.  I was so inspired.  \n\nI got this rose to cover a rather bare, ugly,  new build extension next door imposed on me.  She really delivered.  I look forward to welcoming the flowers each year. \n\nEach year,  throughout the season,  I get the most beautiful white with pink blush roses nodding on green growth.  Today,  28 April,  I'm looking at 20 or 30 budding roses. 3 already blooming.  Thinking back to my Sissinghurst visit. \n\nI trim back hard in winter,  keeping my 'tree' structure.  The rose looks gorgeous year on year. Visited by bluetits and wrens, ladybirds and pollinators.  Thank you Madame Alfred and Vita S-W.",

        "body": "Arrived as a healthy bare root in November last year. Planted as per website instructions. It is June now and has many flowers. It is a very healthy plant and has no diseases so far, eventhough I’ve had some sawfly issues with my other new roses. It’s also wind resistant and due to the small size of blooms the petals remain steadfast which is a bonus in my windy exposed garden. The only drawback is that it hasn’t grown much in height. It is still a small low shrub and has not “climbed” up the fence. I am hoping to cover a large fence and I’m not sure how long this is going to take. Overall I am very happy with it. Easy to look after and I love the changing colours and hues of this rose. Scent very light.",

I had about 10 flowers (cool pale pink) on dark green glossy foliage. In Oct 24 I transferred to a south facing (clay-ish) border about 1.5m in and it tripled in size this spring and the first flush was  in early June stunning … double the blooms of the previous season. It just needed a bit of support as the foliage is quite immature to hold the huge blooms … which I am sure with strength over time.  We are end of 1st week in July and we have more new foliage and more buds forming up.     So very pleased …. That I have gone on to buy 8 more  DA roses - a mix of bare roots and plants … and I love Desdemona that I am learning about this season.   Just watching them like a hawk with our hot season 2025  here in UK.  P all roses recieved sustained release granulesi. March and end of June with organic seaweed liquid feeds weekly from end of April.",

        "body": "Planted this rose in 2022 against the east facing wall. It is a very fast grower, however, suffers from white mildew (none of my other roses do), which results in curving leaves and damaged flowers. Fungicides do not seem to help for long, eventually mildew spreads all over the plant, and due to the size it is impossible to spray the whole rose anyway.  Also more of an aphid magnet compared to other roses. Flowers are fragrant and long lasting, but as a slight downside - petals do not fall off, flowers just turn brown and dry on the plant making it look unattractive, as deadheading it is very difficult due to it's size.",

It needs you to be brutal and it’ll reward you. Absolutely love the way the flowers change colour and still very thankful for the gift :)",
