    "body": "Both of my grandmothers grew this rose in the States and I looked for years for it.  Was thrilled to find it here when I moved to the UK.  This wonderful rose is hardy, healthy, well, behaved, adds a lovely scent to my whole garden and is the first to bloom every spring and is still in bloom long after the rest of my roses stop blooming for the year.",
