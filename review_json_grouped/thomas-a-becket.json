    "body": "I came across this rose in a garden centre and fell in love; it had to come home with me. I was confused though, because I'd never heard of this variety before, and when I looked it up here, realised why. It's listed as a \"red\" rose, which I would never look at. In reality it is actually a vivid, rich, deep pink - but definitely not red. Smell is rather light but beautiful.",

They\u2019ve put on good growth but sadly the roses seem to be too heavy for the stems and flop over with some snapping off before they fully bloom. . Extremely disappointing as they cost over \u00a3100 and I\u2019m now contemplating replacing them with something more reliable.",
