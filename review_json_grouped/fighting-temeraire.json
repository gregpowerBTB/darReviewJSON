    "body": "I adore this rose for many reasons. It is very attractive and pretty rose, the blooms are huge and delicate looking. The bees adore it which is very important to me. The colour is a breath taking peachy apricot, it is a ray of sunshine in the garden.  I have three and will probably purchase more. You can only ever buy this rose as a bareroot which is a shame. In my opinion it is one of DA most captivating and beautiful rose they have. I recommend it highly. I wish they sold it as potted it, would get more appreciation which it certainly deserves.",
