    "body": "I bought this beautiful rose and planted it in my front garden almost 5 years ago. The scent is delicious and the blooms are eye catching. Recently I have bought David Austin Rose Food and I gave it a good scoopful a few weeks ago. I have noticed that it has grown a lot taller and wider than in previous years and there are tons of buds so I am so excited to see them burst into colour. My neighbours look at it everyday and are impatient to see it too.",
