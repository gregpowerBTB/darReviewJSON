    "body": "I was recommend this rose by someone online and am thrilled I was.\n\nIts a creamy white, not yellow. Its in year 2 and a narrow pot. First year SW wall second year NW wall and has thrived in both from BR. Year 2 it has tripled in buds. It forms clusters of frilly gorgeous blooms around 3 to 4cm. I cant smell so I cant comment on that. Its a great choice if you want something different that is not pink.",
