It was well looked after with plenty of compost, sunny spot, well watered in the summer months and fertilised to promote growth. Yet it is barely 14 inch high with very thin stems with no Autumn cut back being so small already ... David Austin tells me to wait and use more fertiliser but my view is that bare foot is a gamble. If you want 100% rapid success, opt for the potted plant. As an experienced gardener,  I will of course continue to nurture it but I am most disappointed.",
