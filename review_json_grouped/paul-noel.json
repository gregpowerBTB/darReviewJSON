    "title": "Beautiful but not healthy",
    "body": "Planted this rose in 2022 against the east facing wall. It is a very fast grower, however, suffers from white mildew (none of my other roses do), which results in curving leaves and damaged flowers. Fungicides do not seem to help for long, eventually mildew spreads all over the plant, and due to the size it is impossible to spray the whole rose anyway.  Also more of an aphid magnet compared to other roses. Flowers are fragrant and long lasting, but as a slight downside - petals do not fall off, flowers just turn brown and dry on the plant making it look unattractive, as deadheading it is very difficult due to it's size.",
